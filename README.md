Just a few old hobby scripts of mine in Python

I would be keeping
 - a few good old scripts of mine, so that I can format my machine whenever I need without any problem.
 - future scripts that I'm going to write (only if I feel that they will be useful in the future).

And Yeah, PRs are most welcome.
